# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game built in **Python**.  
This project is a fun way to practice programming basics such as user input, random number generation, and control flow in Python.

The game allows a player to compete against the computer in the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors challenge. Each round, the player chooses between Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly selects its move. The program then compares both choices and declares a winner according to the well-known rules:

- Rock crushes Scissors  
- Scissors cut Paper  
- Paper covers Rock  

This project is beginner-friendly, lightweight, and demonstrates how simple logic and Python’s built-in modules can be combined to create an interactive game.
